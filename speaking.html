    "body": "REDUCING COMPLEXITY AND SHORTENING FEEDBACK LOOPS WITH FEATURE TOGGLES: Jan, 2018 / PragPub Magazine One of the challenges of Continuous Delivery (CD) arises when a feature spans multiple commits, and an urgent fix needs to be released before the development of that feature is complete. When a feature is completed and deployed to production, teams also need a way to experiment safely, beta testing with a small group of users and being able to roll back quickly if an undesirable experience is observed. Feature toggles to the rescue. This article explains this practice, which was common twenty years ago and is being rediscovered today. DEVELOPING AN END-TO-END WINDOWS STORE APP USING JAVASCRIPT: HILO: Nov 29, 2012 / Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices The JavaScript version of the Hilo photo sample provides guidance to JavaScript developers who want to create a Windows 8 app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the Windows Runtime, and modern development patterns. Hilo comes with source code and documentation. SECTTS: A SECURE TRACK &amp; TRACE SYSTEM FOR RFID-ENABLED SUPPLY CHAINS: May 28, 2012 / Computers in Industry (Elsevier B. V. ) Due to the highly sensitive business information communicated within RFID-enabled supply chain networks, there is an urgent need for a secure and effective track &amp; trace system. In this paper, we aim to design and implement a secure track &amp; trace system (SecTTS) based on the EPCglobal network where the EPC Discovery Services (EPCDSs) is the most important component. In SecTTS, the EPCDS is designed as a semi-trusted server, contrasting the assumptions of previous works, which requires a trusted EPCDS. Our EPCDS is implemented based on the relay model where set-based relay policy is proposed to allow each supply chain partner to define different relay policies for information with different sensitivity. We implement a prototype of SecTTS and conduct extensive experiments. The results validate that our design is practical and cost effective. ￼￼￼ SECDS : A SECURE EPC DISCOVERY SERVICE SYSTEM IN EPCGLOBAL NETWORK: Feb 7, 2012 / ACM (CODASPY’12) In recent years, the Internet of Things (IOT) has drawn con- siderable attention from the industrial and research commu- nities. Due to the vast amount of data generated through IOT devices and users, there is an urgent need for an ef- fective search engine to help us make sense of this massive amount of data. With this motivation, we begin our ini- tial works on developing a secure and efficient search en- gine (SecDS) based on EPC Discovery Services (EPCDS) for EPCglobal network, an integral part of IOT. SecDS is designed to provide a bridge between different partners of supply chains to share information while enabling them to find who is in possession of an item. The most importan- t property of SecDS is: while efficiently processing user’s search, it is also secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access to SecDS, an extended attribute-based access control model is proposed and implemented such that information belonging to different companies can be protected using d- ifferent policies.

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

    "title": "The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format",
    "body": "2019/02/02 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.

Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key.

First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "
